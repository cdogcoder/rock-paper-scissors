# rock-paper-scissors

Hey everyone! This is my first JS project of the Odin Project curriculum and in this project, I will be creating a console-only game of Rock Paper Scissors! It should reflect many, if not, all the skills I have learned up until this point about JS like variables, conditionals, and functions for example, as well as some non-technical skills like problem solving and debugging errors that were taught in a few of the lessons. With that being said, I hope you all like this project and thank you for viewing this repo!

UPDATE:
Hello everyone! I am back to update this rock paper scissors game project with... you guessed it! A UI BABY, woohoo! After learning more how to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript, I am now ready to take on this task of reworking my console-based game code into a crafty and clean program with buttons and text on the screen for you to play. With that said, thanks for viewing this repo!
